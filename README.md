## Description

I wanted to build  a collection of blogs techstuff, and other random techlife things that add to my life. Then publish them for you, and well myself.

This was taken from the project [here](https://fruitriin.github.io/VuePressOnGithubPageTemplate/).

Then after that. I added a few things, and I turned it into a template [here](https://github.com/Datapotomus/vuepress-starter)

After that from that template I started building my actual site.
